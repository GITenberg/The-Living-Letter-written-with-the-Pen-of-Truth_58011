<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Epistle out of which this Text
is selected, was with the one proceeding it, written to the
Church of Jesus at Corinth; many of the Lord&rsquo;s elect people
were in this place, and the Apostle Paul was sent here to
proclaim the glad tidings of salvation; the Lord was graciously
with him, and gave testimony to the word of his grace, those who
received the truth, being knit together in spirit, formed
themselves into a body.&nbsp; Among them the Apostle abode two
years and then departed.&nbsp; Soon after his departure he heard
of their dissentions; defections in doctrines and ordinances,
luxury, intemperance, uncleanness, and abuses of their religious
liberties, litigious law suits and irregularities in their public
assemblies, <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>he writes this Epistle to correct them, to warn,
instruct, and direct in all important subjects.&nbsp; False
teachers made sad work among them likewise; endeavouring to set
their minds against the Apostle to bring him into contempt that
his ministry might lose its efficacy, and also to misrepresent
his doctrine, as tending to licentiousness, whereas there was
nothing but the violation of law and conscience, the effect of
their ministry and which is to be seen to this day amongst most
teachers of the law such as direct their hearers to the law
instead of Jesus, as the law fulfiller:&mdash;these in general
are full of wrath, bitterness, pride, and carnal enmity, and
though great advocates for holiness and good works never perform
any without making it well known, that they may have to plead in
the last day:&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, Lord, have we not done many
wonderful works?&rdquo;&nbsp; However the Apostle in this second
epistle triumphs, that his ministry is a sweet savour to God; to
some it would terminate in their present salvation, to others add
to their condemnation for rejecting it.&nbsp; Then he levels his
artillery at those false apostles, who had formed themselves into
a body and gave letters of recommendation to one another to the
Churches where they went, they could go no where without these
letters.&nbsp; But Paul and every true Apostle needed not such
recommendation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we begin again to commend ourselves to you, or need
we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters
of commendation <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>from you?&rdquo;&nbsp; No, ye are our epistles; you were
written on our hearts, we travailed in spirit for your
conversion, and all could see the change made in you, it was so
clearly manifested to be the writing of Christ, which we preach;
the impressions made on you could not be erased from the mind,
and which will be seen in the last great day.&nbsp; So runs the
Text which we will proceed to notice in the following order:
first, the writing; secondly, the means; thirdly, its publicity:
&ldquo;Ye are our epistles written in our hearts, known and read
of all men.&rdquo;&nbsp; We shall first consider the
writing.&nbsp; First, the writing: Our covenant, God has promised
that he will write his laws on the hearts of his people; that he
will write on them his new name and the city of God.&nbsp; These
blessings in the heart are the writings he himself will own it is
his own image and the superscription to this image all the elect
people of God are divinely predestinated; there never was but one
image in which the great Jehovah expressed his delight, namely,
&ldquo;Behold, my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my
soul delighteth.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the image and all others he
will surely despise: this image is the pattern model exemplar, it
is Christ&rsquo;s holy nature and as the elect head of his
family, possessing all divine and human excellencies, graces and
qualifications; these excellencies shining in the human nature
even in the seven-fold operations of the holy spirit that was
upon him, this was the image in which God made man: &ldquo;in <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the image of
God made he man.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this he delighted even from
eternity, for Adam was formed the shadow of him that was to come,
from this image Adam fell, and to this we are brought again by
the renewing influences of the Holy Ghost: hence the Apostle
says, we all with open face beholding as in a glass, the glory of
the Lord are changed into the same image, this image the Apostle
declares is wisdom, righteousness and true holiness, it is an
experimental knowledge of Jesus and a covenant God in him.&nbsp;
Our dear Lord is called wisdom.&nbsp; God made man and endued him
with wisdom and we are made wise unto salvation, through faith in
Christ Jesus, this image is love; the Saviour is love also; Adam
had it, and it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
given to us; this image is righteousness: this is another name
our Lord bears; in righteousness the first Adam was created and
our privilege is to know that in the Lord we have righteousness
and strength; this image is true holiness, it is the holy spirit
that makes a man holy a spirit of light, life and love, this holy
spirit breathed into Adam the breath of life,&mdash;rested on the
Redeemer and takes up its abode in every believer&rsquo;s
heart&mdash;all holiness besides this is false&mdash;this is
writing on us, this is stamping the image of Jesus: love to this
image wherever we see it, evidences we are passed from death unto
life;&mdash;this image which Christ bears, he stamped on the
hearts of his Apostles; the church being converted through <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>their ministry
having this image communicated to their souls, are called their
children, for this the Apostles travailed in spirit till Christ
was formed in them the hope of glory.&nbsp; Second, the writing
in my Text is not only the image of God, but also the words of
truth which these men preached,&mdash;hence Paul says in the
Text, this writing was ministered by us, these words are of
Divine Authority, they were first received of the Father, by the
Lord Jesus in the everlasting Covenant; during our Lord&rsquo;s
Ministry upon the earth they were applied to the hearts of the
Apostles; hence the Redeemer says, in John xvii.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have given them the words thou gavest me, and they have believed
thou didst send me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Saviour received the
Father&rsquo;s Mind and Will concerning the elect and their
salvation; this was written on his heart, then copied off in the
word, and afterwards wrote on the hearts of God&rsquo;s
Ministers, and through them conveyed to the hearts of God&rsquo;s
elect with power:&mdash;the Will of the Father is made known to
Christ as Mediator,&mdash;the Saviour makes it known in his word
by his spirit, and ministers to God&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; Thus
it appears, what is in Christ&rsquo;s human nature, is to be
found in all his people, and what the Father has made known to
him, he has kindly revealed to us,&mdash;this appears the sense
of the writing in the Text, the love of God shed abroad in the
heart, and the word having an abiding place in the soul,
producing its glorious fruits to his honor; these are the laws
written <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>within, not on tables of stone, which could receive no
lively impression, but on the new hearts, God has promised to
give his people:&mdash;I come secondly, to shew the means,
&ldquo;written by us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who receive the truth in
the love of it are compared to epistles or letters wrote which
contain the mind and will of God, and it is evident there must be
pen, paper, and ink.&nbsp; To this the Apostle alludes; here the
minister is compared to a pen, to shew their meaness, their
entire dependance, and that they cannot act to any good purpose
only as they are led; as pens, they must be shaped, formed, cut
on purpose, simple means, yet accomplishing great ends, no merit
due, yet useful, pleasant, and prized as it suits the purpose,
hard or soft, giving broad or fine strokes, often wants nibbing
or mending, used to write on various subjects, charges,
sentences, consolations, love, promises, and pardons:&mdash;this
is a fit emblem of the ministers of the gospel in their different
gifts, as called and qualified by the Great Head of the
church.&nbsp; Some of the most simple, mean, and obscure
characters have been employed in this service of Jesus in the
great work of the ministry.&nbsp; Elisha, from following the
plough, David, the sheep, and Amos from the herds, Peter, and the
other Apostles from their fishing-boats, John Bunyan from mending
kettles, and William Huntington from the coal barge: and Paul
declares that God has chosen the base things to confound the
wise, that no flesh should glory in his presence.&nbsp; Such
ministers are cut <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>and formed for the work; cut also from the from of
Godliness, from fleshly confidences, from dependance, or any
thing short of the Almighty minister in the Church.&nbsp; By
trials, by divine light, life and love, by knowledge and wisdom
they are formed and furnished in heart, head, and tongue.&nbsp;
Hence Paul says, God has made us ministers of the New Testament,
and spiritual counsel in the heart of such men, is as deep water,
and men of understanding shall draw it out.&nbsp; This makes
their tongue like the pen of a ready writer, whilst their hearts
teach their mouths and adds learning to their lips; by such means
the spirit has accomplished the external designs of Jehovah, in
bringing souls to the knowledge of a dear Saviour; hence the
Prophet predicts the glorious effects of converting grace: they
shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into
pruning hooks;&mdash;this may be seen in Paul, and many others
who have been persecutors, whose hearts and tongues have been
afterwards used in turning up the ground of sinner&rsquo;s
hearts, and employed in God&rsquo;s vintage.&nbsp; No merit is
due to the greatest preacher in the world, for he is nothing but
as he is made, used and guided any more than a pen; hence the
acknowledgement of one minister, for all I laboured more
abundantly than they all, yet not I but the grace God; we must
speak as the spirit of God gives us utterance, and as we are led
into the truths of God&rsquo;s most holy word, nor can we go but
as we are led;&mdash;whence the promise, he shall guide <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>you into all
truths; all means must be used by the minister; it is the spirit
alone can bless in public and private; God giveth the increase,
as pens differ, so do the ministers of God in their knowledge and
ability, having different gifts, some give broad, others fine
strokes, some cry an alarm in God&rsquo;s holy mountains, others
speak more comfortably.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that believeth not shall
be damned,&rdquo; &ldquo;except a man be born again he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God:&rdquo; these are broad strokes
indeed; others are commanded to cry unto her that her iniquity is
pardoned, to shew the richess of grace and mercy in the salvation
of the soul, the covenant love, ancient counsels, the glorious
end of the law, and the unspeakable efficacy of the blood of the
lamb:&mdash;some are capacitated to explain mysterious passages
in the word; mysterious experience of grace and providence; such
are sons of consolation, all these worketh that one, and the
self-same spirit that divideth to every man severally as he
will.&nbsp; As pens, we often want mending, we are apt to get
dull when God is pleased to cut us, that we may be the more
useful to others; if we are afflicted, it is for your
consolation; this appears hard to us,&mdash;but faith bows with
adoring submission, when the head fall into the water.&nbsp; The
Prophet cut down a stick and cast it into the water also, which
brought it up again; so the Lord appoints that his ministers
should dive deep into tribulations to bring out his dear elect
people.&nbsp; These pens are used to write charges and
sentences.&nbsp; So Peter charged the blood <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of Christ to
the consciences of his hearers; and Paul declares if the Gospel
be hid, be it hid to them that are lost.&nbsp; The Saviour said
whatsoever they bind on earth should be bound in heaven.&nbsp;
Pens are used to write on subjects of consolation, pardons, and
promises, and these glad tidings we are to proclaim to the broken
and contrite hearts of God&rsquo;s people; these must be held in
his hands and used at his pleasure to accomplish his good will of
purpose and promise.&nbsp; These must in time be wore out and
laid aside, affecting thought, yet glorious prospect.&nbsp; Your
Fathers, where are they, and do the Prophets live for ever?&nbsp;
Death worketh in us, but life in you, as candles that waste away
their bodies in giving light to others.&nbsp; This the Prophet
saw in the vision of Cherubims, when they stood they let down
their wings.&nbsp; I have often admired the wisdom of God in the
qualifications of his dear ministers.&nbsp; Let not one minister
envy, oppose or speak against another, every one will and must do
his own work; they can never do the work of another.&nbsp; Here I
must introduce a beautiful though simple, yet just and candid
remark of Mr. Huntington, in his book called the Qualifications
of a Minister, page 316.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s army in
London is marshalled in three ranks; there are some professing
nobility and gentry; these being learned, God sends gentlemen of
eminent learning to preach to them:&mdash;the second rank
consists chiefly of mechanics of good education, and God sends
mechanics to preach to them: the third battallion consists of <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>servants,
journeyman, a great number of old chair women, together with some
scavengers, lamp-lighters, and hod-men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, you and
I must be standard bearers to this battallion of light infantry,
and we are protected by the same laws, fight under the same
banner, and are no less beloved of the same king; our temporal
pay may be less, put perhaps our spiritual pay is more.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye are our epistle written on our hearts,&rdquo; the paper
on which these things are written.&nbsp; Christ and his word are
the writing; the Apostle says it is the heart; I will write my
laws on their hearts;&mdash;hence the prayer, Lord have mercy
upon us and write all these thy laws on our hearts we beseech
thee?&nbsp; The first law wrote on the heart is the moral law;
this is sent home to shew us our sin and danger, to point out our
state, and make us feel our guilt.&nbsp; By the law is the
knowledge of sin; I had not known it but for the law; under this
tuition we are, till Jesus proclaims liberty from its curse and
bondage, then we are at liberty to serve him as sons and not as
slaves, in imputed righteousness, in the spirit of holiness and
in filial fear.&nbsp; This is the design of the liberty of the
Gospel: Christ formed in the heart&mdash;faith wrought, there
embracing the atonement, purifying the conscience, whilst a good
hope through grace leads and animates us with the purity of mind
and conduct; this is the writing on the heart, not merely in the
head or outward conduct.&nbsp; A man may have clear notions and a
moral conduct, and yet nothing of this writing on the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>heart,
because destitute of the new heart itself.&nbsp; This new heart
are the faculties of the soul under the divine influence of the
holy spirit.&nbsp; This is the paper or parchment; the
understanding is enlightened, the will bent on God-ward, the
affections led to Jesus, the thoughts occupied about divine
things, and the conscience renewed quickened and made
tender.&nbsp; On this heart these impressions are made for ever,
the ink used, is the gracious influence of the spirit;&mdash;not
literal ink, or the ink of human eloquence, nor merely moving the
passions or affecting the body; but, the sacred powerful workings
of the Holy Ghost; hence the Apostle calls it the demonstration
of the spirit; the Saviour calls it shewing the things that are
his: this is done in such power as proves it the work of
God.&nbsp; All other religion but that which is attended with
this power will fall to nothing like the lamps of the foolish
virgins.&nbsp; This accounts for the apostacy of many who have
run well for a time and then stopped for ever; what the spirit
wrote on us can never be broken, or washed off, or erased, it may
at times be hid from the possessor and from others, but it will
be seen again when the Saviour shines, for it is in his light we
are light; the hand that begun this letter will also finish it:
hence the Apostle says, he was confident, that he who had begun
the good work would finish it.&nbsp; Our spiritual Zerubabel
whose hands begun to build, his hands will also finish it.&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s yea and amen in the eternal covenant is manifested in
the hearts <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>of all God&rsquo;s elect people: hence he
says;&mdash;yea, I have loved thee; this shed abroad in the heart
is the spirit&rsquo;s amen; the believer is thus fitted for glory
by a principle of love to and delight in God, Father, Son and
Spirit.&nbsp; This letter must be sealed; the seal upon this
letter is the secret yet assuring influences of the spirit: hence
the Apostle says, after that ye believed ye were sealed with the
holy spirit of promise; the church is called a fountain sealed,
and God seals his law, his new covenant blessings; 1st among his
disciples; this sealing is intended to shew that what passes
between God and the soul is kept a secret from others:&mdash;2nd.
the security of these blessings, none can rob us of them, they
are secured to us:&mdash;3rd the assurance of interest in these
mercies; this secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and
he will shew them his covenant the work of God on the heart,
agreeing with the word, the spirit blesses us with a holy
confidence that our experience is genuine, that Jesus is ours,
and we are his, that we are interested in the promises of a
faithful God, and we believe and are <i>sure</i>, that when he
shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he
is.&nbsp; This is the seal, the secret, the hidden, the deep the
sure things of God; this makes known to us his love, it is his
own mark,&mdash;his own seal,&mdash;our security from the
vengeance of the Almighty, when his desolating judgment go
through the land,&mdash;our security from eternal death, and
secures our redemption from the grave.&nbsp; Grieve <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>not, the holy
spirit whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
redemption;&mdash;truly dreadful and presumptuous, are those who
attempt to imitate this seal of the spirit; particularly a
certain pretended Prophetess who attempts to seal those who
embrace her lies, by writing certain words, and assuring her
deluded followers they are to be made heirs of God, and
joint-heirs of Christ; whereas the Lord&rsquo;s elect Have been
made so from all eternity, and it is the blessed work of the holy
spirit to assure the conscience of its eternal security in
Christ.&mdash;Not written on a piece of paper which may be lost,
stolen, worn out, or burnt, but the seal of the spirit will stand
for ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the last fire burns all things
here,<br />
These letters shall securely stand,<br />
And in the Lamb&rsquo;s fair book appear,<br />
Wrote by the Eternal Father&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We notice the direction on it, to our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Covenant Elect Head, the Redeemer and Saviour of poor lost
sinners, whose I am by gift, by purchase, by power, by conquest,
and dedication, first presented to him by the adorable Father in
the counsels of peace; then by the eternal spirit at my
conversion, and having his image written on my soul.&nbsp; I am
directed to him as my owner, my portion, my master, my eternal
all,&mdash;from him I derived my spiritual life; to him I am
devoted, I am his sole property and shall be to him a praise, a

be to the praise and glory of his own grace, formed for himself,
to shew forth his praise, this is the direction written by the
spirit, and as the soul now rises often to him in sweet
affection, so it will at death, when the writing is finished, and
to all eternity rivers of love, joy, and satisfaction will flow
from him to his dear elect, so it will sweetly return to him

<p>Those who will carry these letters home and deliver them to
whom they are directed, are doubtless the elect
angels,&mdash;these attend the church of God individually from
the moment of their birth, till their glorification.&nbsp; The
promise of the Father to Jesus, as the head belongs to the body,
he shall give his angels charge concerning thee to keep thee in
all thy ways.&nbsp; At our conversion they rejoice,&mdash;on the
ministry of the gospel they attend,&mdash;round the dying beds of
God&rsquo;s people they wait,&mdash;till they perform the last
act of friendship to their souls, by conducting them through into
the hands and glory of their Lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;It came to pass
the beggar died and was carried by angels into Abraham&rsquo;s
Bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp; They will doubtless be employed in the
resurrection of the body, hence the command, &ldquo;gather the

<p>Third.&nbsp; Its publicity,&mdash;known and read of all
men.&nbsp; Ye who have been called out of darkness into
marvellous light by our ministry, and show forth his praises who
has called you by a separation from the world, by a change of
principle and practice.&nbsp; You have been observed, and
thousands have seen the change, and wondered at the cause; they
knew what you once were; they see what you now are; they gaze,
they are astonished, and obliged to acknowledge the
change;&mdash;many hate it, though they cannot but own it is the
finger of God.&nbsp; The Deist ridicules this work as
enthusiasm;&mdash;the Libertine as mere bigotry;&mdash;he learned
consider it as foolishness;&mdash;the Pharisee considers the
principles which produce these effects as antinomian, though they
have produced such glorious consequences and it is very
remarkable that in all ages the great work of the Holy Ghost has
been the subject of ridicule of its professed votaries.&nbsp; And
even in the present day some have called it mental
intoxication.&nbsp; But this work upon the soul produces in its
happy possessor the faith of God&rsquo;s elect; a good hope
through grace,&mdash;fervent love to <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>God,&mdash;unfeigned humility and
gospel charity or love to the household of faith,&mdash;it
reclaims it converts,&mdash;it turns a man&rsquo;s feet to
God&rsquo;s testimonies enables him to deal justly with God, by
making use of the work of Christ,&mdash;to deal justly with man
in all his outward actions, and whilst his faith receives the
Saviour&rsquo;s obedience as the end of the law, he loves that
law of Ten commandments after the inward man, (for by faith, love
and obedience in the spirit every law of God is fulfilled in
him), and by him receiving the atonement in his conscience, the
ceremonial law is fulfilled in its design, embracing the
obedience of Christ, the moral law is fulfilled in him; the laws
of faith, love, liberty, kindness and peace are all manifested to
him, and he loves them all.&nbsp; Great peace are they which love
thy law, and nothing shall offend them.&nbsp; He feels himself
bound by the law of love to walk in all holy obedience to the
laws of Christ, even the preceptive parts of the New Testament;
thus he loves and obeys every law of God, nor is he, nor can he
be against one law of God that is revealed in God&rsquo;s most
holy word.&nbsp; This is the doctrine Paul preached, and these
are the sentiments God has been pleased to reveal to my soul, and
enabled me to preach constantly and faithfully, and this every
real believer must confess, that ever heard me unprejudiced: does
not this give the lye to all those preachers in Town and Country
who have falsely reported that I am an antinomian in principle,
and are continually maintaining antinomian <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>sentiments;
but I bless God none can prove me an antinomian, either in
principle or practice; but it is a lamentable truth constantly
seen, viz. that those who belie a man&rsquo;s principles, will
not scruple to belie a man&rsquo;s practice.&nbsp; Mark this ye
enemies in black; perhaps God has enable me to perform as many,
and more good works, than those who oppose me, though they talk
more about them than I do.&nbsp; Mr. Evans in his Sketch of all
Denominations has given us an account of the sect called
antinomians; but let any impartial Christian read that account
and the above description of a believer, and then charge me with
antinomianism if they dare.&nbsp; The best description I ever
read of an antinomian, was written by the late Mr. Huntington, in
his Sermon:&mdash;&ldquo;Moses unveiled in the face of
Christ;&rdquo; which was afterwards printed in that best of
Periodical Publications, the Gospel Magazine, for the Month of
November 1798, and which I take the liberty to present to my
readers.</p>
<h3><i>A Description of an Antinomian</i>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>A real Antinomian in the sight of God, is one who
<i>holds the truth in unrighteousness</i>, who has Gospel notions
in his head but no grace in his heart: he is one that makes a
profession of Christ Jesus, but was never purged by his blood,
renewed by his spirit, nor saved by his power.&nbsp; With him
<i>carnal ease</i> passes for <i>Gospel peace</i>; <i>a natural
assent</i> of the mind for faith; <i>insensibility</i> <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>for
<i>liberty</i>; and <i>daring presumption</i> for the <i>grace of
assurance</i>.&nbsp; He is alive without the law, the sentence of
the <i>moral law</i> having never been sent home to him.&nbsp;
The <i>law</i> of <i>faith</i> was never sealed <i>on</i> him;
the <i>law</i> of <i>truth</i> was never received <i>by</i> him;
nor the <i>law</i> of <i>liberty</i> proclaimed <i>to</i>
him.&mdash;He was never arraigned at, nor taken from, the
<i>throne</i> of <i>judgment</i>&mdash;He was never justified at
the <i>throne</i> of <i>grace</i>, nor acquitted at the
<i>bar</i> of <i>equity</i>.&mdash;The tremendous attribute of
righteousness was never <i>seen</i> or felt <i>by</i> him; the
righteousness of the law was never fulfilled <i>in</i> him; the
righteousness of the law was never fulfilled <i>by</i> him; the
righteousness of faith was never imputed <i>to</i> him; nor the
<i>fruits</i> of righteousness brought forth <i>by</i> him.&nbsp;
He is an enemy to the power of God, to the experience of the just
and to every minister of the spirit; and is in union with none
but hypocrites, whose uniting ties are <i>the gall of bitterness
and the bonds of iniquity</i>.&nbsp; He is one that often changes
his opinions, but was never changed in heart; he turns to many
sects and parties, but never turns to God.&nbsp; In word he is
false to Satan, in <i>heart</i> he is false to God: false to
Satan by uttering truth, and false to God by a false
profession.&nbsp; He is a false reprover in the world, and in the
household of faith a false brother.&nbsp; He is a child of Satan
in the congregation of dissemblers, and a bastard in the
congregation of the righteous.&nbsp; By mouth he contends for a
covenant that cannot save him, and in heart he hates the covenant
that can.&nbsp; His <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>head is at mount Calvary, his heart and soul at mount
Sinia.&nbsp; He is a pharisee at Horeb, and a hypocrite in Zion;
he is a transgressor of the law of works, and a rebel to the law
of faith; a sinner by the ministry of the letter, and an
unbeliever by the ministry of the spirit.&nbsp; As a <i>wicked
servant</i> he is <i>cursed</i> by the <i>eternal law</i>; and as
an <i>infidel</i> he is <i>damned</i> by the everlasting gospel:
and this is a real antinomian in the sight of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Apostle of old was charged with saying let us do
evil that good may come:&rdquo; this he calls a slanderous report
invented and circulated by those preachers and people who are all
zealous for that law which forbids their lies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I thought it necessary to discuss this point, to contradict the
fiery flying serpents of infamous lies, that many holy kind of
people have industriously circulated with great care, pains, and
expence; is not the accusation of worldly men, which they bring
against professors too true? they will not swear it is true, but
they will lie.&nbsp; The doctrines the Lord has taught me he has
blessed with power to many souls; the change has been seen, nor
could it be denied they have been read of others.&nbsp; The world
has seen the glorious effects of sovereign grace; the church has
admired and blessed God for it; angels have united in the
joy.&nbsp; These letters have been read by ministers who have
been <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>obliged to acknowledge them genuine, even the writing of
God&rsquo;s Spirit; and in fact, none can read the hand writing
on the wall of the heart, but spiritual Daniels; others see the
effect only in the outward conduct, but these see the work
itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Great is the work, my neighbours cried,<br
/>
And owned the power divine,<br />
Great is the work, my heart replied,<br />
But be the glory thine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These letters will be read, in the last great day;&mdash;they
will appear in his image;&mdash;awake up in his likeness, and be
satisfied with his smiles.&nbsp; The image in which the person
dies, he will rise in at the last great day,&mdash;whether the
image of God or Satan; thousands will rise in the image of the
devil, just as they died in a state of enmity against the Most
High God;&mdash;these are the rest of the dead that lived not
again till the thousand years are expired, then Satan and all the
wicked will be released from their prison; come upon the breadth
of the earth;&mdash;compass the beloved city, and foolishly
suppose they can take possession of it.&nbsp; Satan who begun
this work by deceiving, will end it in deceiving, and this will
be the last act of his deception; the image of the devil will be
found on all his children; an image God hates, will reject and
punish but those who bear the image of the heavenly Adam; those
who love this image, will be seen, known, and
acknowledged;&mdash;the adorable Father <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>will
acknowledge the object of his choice, the Saviour;&mdash;the
purchase of his own blood, the holy spirit;&mdash;the work of his
own hand, the ministers of the gospel will see and rejoice in the
characters they were useful to, the whole election of grace will
be received with the joyful welcome, &ldquo;Come ye
blessed;&rdquo; the ungodly will see them exalted, and be obliged
to say, &ldquo;Oh we fools:&rdquo;&mdash;counted their life
madness, and their end without honour.&nbsp; But now they are
numbered with the saints, and their lot is with the children of
God; thus they will be known and read of all men.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
